# coinflips
How well can a human mind simulate coinflips? 
This project is now going to take the following form: 
I'll use the student grades from the six groups of students I teach. I'll design a Shiny app to collect their imaginary 20 coin flips. Then I'll analyze if the coin flips predict their school performance.
